# Faulty-A-Pathfinding-Algorithm
A Faulty A* Path-finding Algorithm. Visualized using tkinter.

**How to Use**

1. First click on the grid is Start Node
2. Second click is End Node
3. Press Start to initialize the algorithm


The algorithm is faulty because it contains a weighted Heuristic calculation (x1.5), and is incomplete. As a result, it cannot pathfind around barriers.
